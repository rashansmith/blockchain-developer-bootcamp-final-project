## Avoiding Common Attacks

### Use of specific compiler pragma:
- SWC-103: Using version 0.8.9

### Reentrancy:
- SWC-107: The OpenZeppelin Reentrancy Guard is used in the smart contract. 

### Use Modifiers Only for Validations:
- Mutliple modifiers were used to validate before making calls to functions.
